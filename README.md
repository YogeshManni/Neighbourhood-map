# Neighbourhood-map
# About
Welcome to my neighbourhood map. In this I have built several markers over the Nagpur(India). You can click on the markers to get information about that place or you can also filter the locations from the searchbar and go to that location. You will also be provided some views or comments about the place you have selected.

## Getting started
You can download the github repository and open index.html to get started.

## Displayed
When the app is first opened it will display a Google Map located in Nagpur, India with 8 locations already marked.
As already discussed you will also find a searchbar on the upper right corner to search the location where you want to go.
All the markers and locations are visible by default. 

## Attributions:
I used Google Maps Api to display the map and set up markers with infowindows etc.
I have also used foursquare API to display the information about the required location. 

Beside this I have also provided enough comments in the code you can easily understand the functioning of code.
